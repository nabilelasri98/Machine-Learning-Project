Abstract Doctor's appointment: study on patients' absences from medical examinations
Having made an appointment with the doctor, is it possible to predict whether a patient will show up or not based on his personal and clinical data and the time he will have to wait before the established date? This question is intended to be the starting point of our study which, trying to predict the possible absences of patients through supervised learning techniques, aims to improve the planning of doctors' agendas and to identify the possible causes that lead people not to show up. Furthermore, this last point would allow medical offices to try to remedy the problem, for example, through clear and timely communication with the patient. Beyond these possible improvements, it is also important to underline that by not showing up for an appointment, therefore not making a visit, you put your health at risk, for example, by not diagnosing serious diseases in time.
